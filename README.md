## Motivation

The study of cluster substructures in galaxy clusters is important for determining their dynamical status, assembly history, and the evolution of clusters in general. In this repo, we present a Python code version of our **DS+** method for the identification and characterization of substructures in clusters. This new method is based on the projected positions and line-of-sight velocities of cluster galaxies, and it is an improvement and extension of the traditional method of [Dressler & Shectman (1988)](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1988AJ.....95..985D). For specifications or details please check our main paper [DS+, link here](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/01/aa45422-22/aa45422-22.html)


## Quick start

Input:
Basic information of galaxies into the cluster, (X/kpc, Y/kpc, Vlos/km s^-1, redshift, others)

Output:
    
Return three arrays:
    - individual information of each galaxy per multiplicity in each DS+ group
    - information of assignment of DS+ groups, with no-overlaping galaxies
    - summary of DS+ identified groups

Example of running program:

Example running:

```
milaDS.DSp_groups(Xcoor=X_data, Ycoor=Y_data, Vlos=Vlos_data, Zclus=0.296, cluster_name="Cl1", nsims=100, Plim_P=10)
```
